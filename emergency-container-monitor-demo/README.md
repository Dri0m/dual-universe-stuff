# emergency-container-monitor-demo

A usable example/demo on how to monitor containers for items and warn user if they are missing something.
This is a demo, the code quality is not as good as I would like it to be, but you should be able to understand what's going on if you're looking for an example. Or just use it as-is, it's good enough for me!
